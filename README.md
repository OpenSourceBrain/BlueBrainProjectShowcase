#### Channelpedia interactions

Some scripts for converting channel files in [Channelpedia](http://channelpedia.epfl.ch/)'s native format to NeuroML2. See [here](Channelpedia) for more details.

#### BBP Neocortical Microcircuit to NeuroML 2

Code for converting cell models from the [Neocortical Microcircuit Collaboration Portal](https://bbp.epfl.ch/nmc-portal/microcircuit)
to NeuroML 2.

See [here](https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/BlueBrainProjectShowcase/blob/master/NMC/NeuroML2/README.md) for more details.
